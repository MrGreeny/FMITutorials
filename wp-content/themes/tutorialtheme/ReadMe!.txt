How to post thumbnail images for the tutorials?

The thumbnail dimensions have been fixed to 129x126 pixels. So keep your thumbnails to that size or you might risk breaking the template.

To upload the thumbnail, follow these steps :-

1. Upload thumbnail just like you will upload a standard image while creating the post.
2. Make a note of the path that wordpress gives you to your uploaded image.
3. Scroll down to find custom fields.
4. Enter key as "thumb" and for the value, paste your uploaded thumbnail path.

Complete your post normally and you will have a thumbnail image next to your tutorial excerpt on the home page of your blog.
